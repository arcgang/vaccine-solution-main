In this section has step by step guidance on how to develop and deploy a model using a simple Model Development Lifecycle Workflow with Governance in Cloud Pak For Data. We show here a very basic workflow. The workflow can be made as complex as needed with sub-workflow with more manual and system controlled gates as needed by a customer.

__Step 1 : Initiate Model Development Lifecycle__

Role - ModelManager

a. Login to OpenPages. Create a Model in OpenPages and assign it Proposed stage
b. Provide Description with Model's details. Additional Description with Model purpose, Data Sources to be used.

d. Createa a Catalog for the model in Watson Knowledge Catalog. Provide the name and link of the Catalog in the respective fields.
e. Save the Model

Role - ModelOwner

f. Login to OpenPages. Go to the Model. Review the Model Deatils
g. Change the model status to Approved for Data Acquisition. Save the Model

__Step 2 : Data Acquizition, Feature Engineering and Model Development__

Role - ModelDataEnginner
