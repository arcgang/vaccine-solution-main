title: Cold-chain monitoring
description: Cold-chain monitoring
---

The vaccine lots need to be kept at a constant temperature for a period of time. The sensor telemetry data coming from the refrigerated shipping containers is processed to assess cold-chain violations.

The solution for this use case includes streaming telemetry events, a stateful microservice to implement aggregation & alarm generation, and integration with a microservice to log issues against the refrigerated shipping container.

## Components involved in this use case

* [Vaccine Reefer Simulator](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-reefer-simulator)
* [Vaccine Monitoring Agent](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent)
* [IBM Event Streams](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/)
* WatsonML-based anomaly detection microservice

## Run on OpenShift

### Prerequsites

1. Create the following artifacts in the `eventstreams` namespace on your OpenShift cluster:

   1. Create an EventStreams instance _(via the [Event Streams Custom Resource](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/installing/installing/#install-an-event-streams-instance))_.
   2. Create a [Kafka User with SCRAM-based credentials](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/security/managing-access/#managing-access-to-kafka-resources), as required by the [Vaccine Reefer Simulator](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-reefer-simulator#application-deployment).
   3. Create a [Kafka User with TLS-based credentials](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/security/managing-access/#managing-access-to-kafka-resources), as required by the [Vaccine Monitoring Agent](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent#create-a-tls-user).
   4. Create two [Kafka Topics](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/getting-started/creating-topics/). This tutorial will assume the names of `coldchain-telemetry` and `coldchain-reefers` respectively.

2. Create a new project named `coldchain` that will be used for the deployment of all other components.
3. The [Appsody Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/appsody-operator) is deployed to manage all namespaces on the OpenShift cluster.
4. [OpenShift CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift-cli) on your local environment.
5. [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) on your local environment.

### Deploy the Vaccine Reefer Simulator

1. Ensure you are working inside the correct project via the following `oc` command:

  ```shell
  oc project coldchain
  ```

2. Export the value of your Event Streams cluster name into an environment variable:

  ```shell
  export CLUSTER_NAME=development
  ```

3. Create a ConfigMap named `reefer-simul-cm` with the following `oc` command:

  ```shell
  oc create configmap reefer-simul-cm \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_CERT=/app/certs/ca.crt \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_MAIN_TOPIC=coldchain-telemetry \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_BROKERS=___kafka-kafka-bootstrap-eventstreams.cluster.appdomain.cloud:443___
  ```
   - Replacing the value of `KAFKA_BROKERS` above with the **External** cluster bootstrap address presented to you during the creation of your SCRAM-based KafkaUser.
   - This value can be accessed via the following `oc` command:
    ```shell
    oc get route -n eventstreams ${CLUSTER_NAME}-kafka-bootstrap -o jsonpath="{.status.ingress[0].host}:443"
    ```

4. Create a Secret named `reefer-simul-secret` with the following `oc` command:

  ```shell
  oc create secret generic reefer-simul-secret \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_USER=___your-scram-based-kafka-user-name___ \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_PASSWORD=___your-scram-based-kafka-user-password___
  ```
   - Replacing the values above with the values generated during the creation of your SCRAM-based KafkaUser.

5. Copy the server-side public certificate of the Event Streams instance to your local project:

  ```shell
  oc get secret ${CLUSTER_NAME}-cluster-ca-cert -n eventstreams --export -o json | jq -r '.metadata.name="kafka-cluster-ca-cert"' | oc apply -f -
  ```
   - Note that we are copying and renaming the certificate in a single command to minimize the need for editing deployment documents.

6. Deploy the microservice components via the following `oc apply` command:

  ```shell
  oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-reefer-simulator/master/config/app-deployment.yaml
  ```

### Deploy the Vaccine Monitoring Agent

1. Ensure you are working inside the correct project via the following `oc` command:

  ```shell
  oc project coldchain
  ```

2. Export the value of your Event Streams cluster name and TLS-based KafkaUser into environment variables:

  ```shell
  export CLUSTER_NAME=development
  export TLS_USER=___your-tls-based-kafka-user-name___
  export YOUR_SUFFIX=___a_unique_identifier_for_your_application___
  ```

3. Create a ConfigMap named `agent-cm` with the following `oc` command:

  ```shell
  oc create configmap agent-cm \
  --from-literal=reefer-topic=coldchain-reefers \
  --from-literal=telemetry-topic=coldchain-telemetry \
  --from-literal=kafka-brokers=${CLUSTER_NAME}-kafka-bootstrap.eventstreams.svc:9093
  --from-literal=consumer-group=cold-chain-agent-${YOUR_SUFFIX}
  ```
   - The value of `telemetry-topic` should match the value used in the creation of the `reefer-simul-cmap` ConfigMap above.

4. If not done so already, copy the server-side public certificate of the Event Streams instance to your local project:

  ```shell
  oc get secret ${CLUSTER_NAME}-cluster-ca-cert -n eventstreams --export -o json | jq -r '.metadata.name="kafka-cluster-ca-cert"' | oc apply -f -
  ```
   - Note that we are copying and renaming the certificate in a single command to minimize the need for editing deployment documents.

5. Copy your TLS-based KafkaUser's credentials to the local namespace with the following `oc` command:

  ```shell
  oc get secret -n eventstreams ${TLS_USER} -o json --export | jq -r '.metadata.name="kafka-user"' | oc apply -f -
  ```
    - Note that we are copying and renaming the credentials in a single command to minimize the need for editing deployment documents.

6. Deploy the microservice components via the following `oc apply` command:

  ```shell
  oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent/master/app-deploy.yaml
  ```

## Scenario script

Once the solution is up and running, execute the following steps to present an end-to-end demonstration:

### Generate vaccine container telemetry events

1. Access the Vaccine Reefer Simulator's Flasgger UI via the following `oc` command:

   ```shell
   oc get route vaccine-reefer-simulator -o jsonpath="http://{.status.ingress[0].host}"
   ```

2. Expand the **POST `/control`** and click **Try it out**.

3. In the **Edit Value** text box, update the values of the records accordingly:
    * **containerID**: `C01`
    * **nb_of_records**: `500`
    * **product_id**: `covid-19`
    * **simulation**: `poweroff`

4. Click **Execute**.

### Analyze simulated reefer telemetry data

1. Access the Event Streams Console UI via the following `oc` command:

   ```shell
   oc get route -n eventstreams ${CLUSTER_NAME}-ibm-es-ui -o jsonpath="https://{.status.ingress[0].host}"
   ```

2. Click **Topics** from the left navigation menu and select the topic that matches the `KAFKA_MAIN_TOPIC` and `telemetry-topic` values.

3. Explore the messages tab and the individual telemetry records emitted by the Vaccine Reefer Simulator component.

### Analyze generated cold-chain violations

1. Click **Topics** from the left navigation menu and selec the topic that matches the `reefer-topic` value.

2. Explore the messages tab and the observed vaccine cold-chain violation alert events.

3. The reefer container information contained in this topic have been identified as having observed temperatures outside the allowable range more than the allowable number of times, as determined to preserve the state of the vaccine doses contained.
