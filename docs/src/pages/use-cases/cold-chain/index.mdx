title: Cold-chain monitoring
description: Cold-chain monitoring
---

The vaccine lots need to be kept at a constant temperature for a period of time. The sensor telemetry data coming from the refrigerated shipping containers is processed to assess cold-chain violations.

The solution for this use case includes streaming telemetry events, a stateful microservice to implement aggregation & alarm generation, and integration with a microservice to log issues against the refrigerated shipping container.

## Components involved in this use case

* [Vaccine Refrigerator container Simulator](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-reefer-simulator)
* [Vaccine Reefer Monitoring Agent](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent)
* [IBM Event Streams](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/)
* [Anomaly detection scoring service](/analyze/ws-ml-dev/) with WatsonML and anomaly detection built in Cloud Pak for Data

*The reefer manager is not done yet*

## Understand the components

* The Reefer simulator is a python  Flask app, which supports simple API to control the Refrigerator container simulation . It is described in [this note](/solution/reefer-iot/), also see next section to deploy it on OpenShift.
* The Monitoring Agent is a Quarkus app, with Kafka Streams, reactive messaging to monitor the cold chain with stateful operations. It also call the Anomaly detection service. Implementation details can be read in [this note](/solution/cold-monitoring/).
* The model to assess if the refrigerator container has issue. To develop the model we need to [get the telemetry data](/solution/cp4d/) in Cloud Pak for data, and then perform feature engineering and use AutoAI for developing the model as described in [this note](/analyze/ws-ml-dev/). As an alternate to collect the data, it is possible to directly [integrate with Kafka topic](/solution/cp4d/eventStream/) and then save then as csv or in a datalake.

## Run on OpenShift

### Prerequsites

1. Create the following artifacts in the `eventstreams` namespace on your OpenShift cluster:

   1. Create an EventStreams instance _(via the [Event Streams Custom Resource](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/installing/installing/#install-an-event-streams-instance))_.
   2. Create a [Kafka User with SCRAM-based credentials](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/security/managing-access/#managing-access-to-kafka-resources), as required by the [Vaccine Reefer Simulator](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-reefer-simulator#application-deployment).
   3. Create a [Kafka User with TLS-based credentials](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/security/managing-access/#managing-access-to-kafka-resources), as required by the [Vaccine Monitoring Agent](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent#create-a-tls-user).
   4. Create two [Kafka Topics](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/getting-started/creating-topics/). This tutorial will assume the names of `coldchain-telemetry` and `coldchain-reefers` respectively.

2. Create a new project named `coldchain` that will be used for the deployment of all other components.
3. The [Appsody Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/appsody-operator) is deployed to manage all namespaces on the OpenShift cluster.
4. [OpenShift CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift-cli) on your local environment.
5. [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) on your local environment.

### Deploy the Vaccine Reefer Simulator

To get more detail of this Python Flask application [read this note](/solution/reefer-iot/).

1. Ensure you are working inside the correct project via the following `oc` command:

  ```shell
  oc project coldchain
  ```

2. Export the value of your Event Streams cluster name into an environment variable:

  ```shell
  export CLUSTER_NAME=development
  ```

3. Create a ConfigMap named `reefer-simul-cm` with the following `oc` command:

  ```shell
  oc create configmap reefer-simul-cm \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_CERT=/app/certs/ca.crt \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_MAIN_TOPIC=coldchain-telemetry \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_BROKERS=___kafka-kafka-bootstrap-eventstreams.cluster.appdomain.cloud:443___
  ```
   - Replacing the value of `KAFKA_BROKERS` above with the **External** cluster bootstrap address presented to you during the creation of your SCRAM-based KafkaUser.
   - This value can be accessed via the following `oc` command:
    ```shell
    oc get route -n eventstreams ${CLUSTER_NAME}-kafka-bootstrap -o jsonpath="{.status.ingress[0].host}:443"
    ```

4. Create a Secret named `reefer-simul-secret` with the following `oc` command:

  ```shell
  oc create secret generic reefer-simul-secret \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_USER=___your-scram-based-kafka-user-name___ \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_PASSWORD=___your-scram-based-kafka-user-password___
  ```
   - Replacing the values above with the values generated during the creation of your SCRAM-based KafkaUser.

5. Copy the server-side public certificate of the Event Streams instance to your local project:

  ```shell
  oc get secret ${CLUSTER_NAME}-cluster-ca-cert -n eventstreams -o json | jq -r '.metadata.name="kafka-cluster-ca-cert"' |jq -r '.metadata.namespace="coldchain"' | oc apply -f -
  ```
   - Note that we are copying and renaming the certificate in a single command to minimize the need for editing deployment documents.

6. Deploy the microservice components via the following `oc apply` command:

  ```shell
  oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-reefer-simulator/master/config/app-deployment.yaml
  ```

  You can verify the deployment state with the following:

  ```shell
  oc get pods -w
  ```

or the via the Openshift console:

### Deploy the Vaccine Monitoring Agent

To get more detail of this Java Quarkus microprofile application [read this note](/solution/cold-monitoring/). The project repository is [https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent)


1. Ensure you are working inside the correct project via the following `oc` command:

  ```shell
  oc project coldchain
  ```
 
1. If not done so already, copy the server-side public certificate of the Event Streams instance to your local project:

  ```shell
  oc get secret ${CLUSTER_NAME}-cluster-ca-cert -n eventstreams --export -o json | jq -r '.metadata.name="kafka-cluster-ca-cert"' | oc apply -f -
  ```
   - Note that we are copying and renaming the certificate in a single command to minimize the need for editing deployment documents.

1. Copy your TLS-based KafkaUser's credentials to the local namespace with the following `oc` command:

  ```shell
  oc get secret -n eventstreams ${TLS_USER} -o json --export | jq -r '.metadata.name="kafka-user"' | oc apply -f -
  ```
    - Note that we are copying and renaming the credentials in a single command to minimize the need for editing deployment documents.
2. Export the value of your Event Streams cluster name and TLS-based KafkaUser into environment variables:

  ```shell
  export CLUSTER_NAME=development
  export TLS_USER=___your-tls-based-kafka-user-name___
  export YOUR_SUFFIX=___a_unique_identifier_for_your_application___
  ```

1. If you use the Anomaly detection service deployed in Watson ML:

   * Get user credential to access to cloud pack for data, with the API key.
   * Get the ANOMALY_DETECTION_URL
   * Get the CP4D_AUTH_URL used to get access token

  You will use those values in the config map of this application.

3. Create a ConfigMap named `agent-cm` (see exising one [here](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent/blob/master/src/main/kubernetes/configmap.yaml)) with the following `oc` command:

 ```shell
  # USE this if you do not use the anomaly detection service
  oc create configmap agent-cm \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_USER=app-tls \
  --from-literal=reefer-topic=coldchain-reefers \
  --from-literal=telemetry-topic=coldchain-telemetry \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=${CLUSTER_NAME}-kafka-bootstrap.eventstreams.svc:9093 \
  --from-literal=QUARKUS_KAFKA_STREAMS_APPLICATION_ID=cold-chain-agent-${YOUR_SUFFIX} \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM=SCRAM-SHA-512 \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL=SASL_SSL
  # USE the command below if you USE the anomaly detection service
  oc create configmap agent-cm \
  --from-literal=reefer-topic=coldchain-reefers \
  --from-literal=telemetry-topic=coldchain-telemetry \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=${CLUSTER_NAME}-kafka-bootstrap.eventstreams.svc:9093 \
  --from-literal=QUARKUS_KAFKA_STREAMS_APPLICATION_ID=cold-chain-agent-${YOUR_SUFFIX} \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM=SCRAM-SHA-512 \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL=SASL_SSL \
  --from-literal=CP4D_AUTH_URL=  \
  --from-literal=CP4D_USER: <cp4d user> \
  --from-literal=CP4D_AUTH_URL: \
  --from-literal=PREDICTION_ENABLED=true

 ```

  The value of `telemetry-topic` should match the value used in the creation of the `reefer-simul-cmap` ConfigMap above.

4. Define a secret with:

  ```shell
  oc create secret generic reefer-simul-secret \
  --from-literal=ANOMALY_DETECTION_URL=https://zen-cpd-ze.../predictions?version=2021-01-28 \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_USER=app-tls \
  --from-literal=KAFKA_PASSWORD=... \
    CP4D_USER: jboyer
    CP4D_APIKEY: YdnIRC3WnuBziDvq98J00t4Crq8BtwsixwtKiALa
    CP4D_AUTH_URL: https://zen-cpd-zen.apps.cpdv35-swat.cpd-daell.com/icp4d-api/v1/authorize
  ```

6. Deploy the microservice components via the following `oc apply` command:

  ```shell
  oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent/master/src/main/kubernetes/openshift.yaml
  ```

  *The openshift.yaml is, in fact created using the `application.properties` and with the following command: `./mvnw clean package` and placed under `target/kubernetes`. We have copied this generated file for conveniance.*
