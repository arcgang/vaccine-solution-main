title: Order management and optimization deployed with EventStreams
description: Order management and optimization demonstration

1. Create the following artifacts in the `eventstreams` namespace on your OpenShift cluster:

   1. Create an EventStreams instance _(via the [Event Streams Custom Resource](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/installing/installing/#install-an-event-streams-instance))_.
   2. Create a [Kafka User with SCRAM-based credentials](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/security/managing-access/#managing-access-to-kafka-resources), as required by the [Vaccine Reefer Simulator](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-reefer-simulator#application-deployment).
   3. Create a [Kafka User with TLS-based credentials](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/security/managing-access/#managing-access-to-kafka-resources), as required by the [Vaccine Monitoring Agent](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent#create-a-tls-user).
   4. Create two [Kafka Topics](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/getting-started/creating-topics/). This tutorial will assume the names of `vaccine.shipment.plans` respectively.
