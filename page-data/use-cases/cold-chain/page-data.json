Deploy the microservice components via the following `oc apply` command:\n\n  ```shell\n  oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-reefer-simulator/master/config/app-deployment.yaml\n  ```\n\n   - note if you want to build, clone [the repository](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-reefer-simulator) and follows the readme.\n\n   You can verify the deployment state with the following:\n\n   ```shell\n   oc get pods -w\n   ```\n\n  or the via the Openshift console:\n\n  ![2](./images/simul-app-ocp.png)\n\n7. Get the route for running the demo: `oc get routes`\nSee the [demo section](#generate_vaccine_container_telemetry_events) to trigger telemetries generation.\n\n\n### Deploy the Vaccine Monitoring Agent\n\nTo get more detail of this Java Quarkus microprofile application [read this note](/solution/cold-monitoring/). The project repository is [https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent)\n\n\n1. Ensure you are working inside the correct project via the following `oc` command:\n\n  ```shell\n  oc project coldchain\n  ```\n \n1. If not done so already, copy the server-side public certificate of the Event Streams instance to your local project:\n\n  ```shell\n  oc get secret ${CLUSTER_NAME}-cluster-ca-cert -n <YOUR_EVENT_STREAMS_NAMESPACE> --export -o json | jq -r '.metadata.name=\"kafka-cluster-ca-cert\"' |jq -r '.metadata.namespace=\"coldchain\"' | oc apply -f -\n  ```\n   - Note that we are copying and renaming the certificate in a single command to minimize the need for editing deployment documents.\n\n1. Copy your TLS-based KafkaUser's credentials to the local namespace with the following `oc` command:\n\n  ```shell\n  oc get secret -n <YOUR_EVENT_STREAMS_NAMESPACE> ${TLS_USER} -o json | jq -r '.metadata.name=\"${TLS_USER}\"' |jq -r '.metadata.namespace=\"coldchain\"' | oc apply -f -\n  ```\n    - Note that we are copying and renaming the credentials in a single command to minimize the need for editing deployment documents.\n    - If you dont remember your tls Kafka User:\n    ```shell\n    $ oc get kafkausers -n integration\n    NAME                     CLUSTER         AUTHENTICATION   AUTHORIZATION\n    kafka-tls-user           development     tls              simple\n    ```\n\n1. Export the value of your Event Streams cluster name and TLS-based KafkaUser into environment variables. The tls-based-kafka-user-name is our previous setting is `kafka-tls-user`, if you changed this name, ensure it matches\n\n  ```shell\n  export CLUSTER_NAME=development\n  export PROJECT_NAME=coldchain\n  export TLS_USER=__your-tls-based-kafka-user-name__\n  export YOUR_SUFFIX=___a_unique_identifier_for_your_application___\n  ```\n\n1. If you use the Anomaly detection service deployed in Watson ML:\n\n   * Get user credential to access to cloud pack for data, with the API key.\n   * Get the ANOMALY_DETECTION_URL\n   * Get the CP4D_AUTH_URL used to get access token\n\n  You will use those values in the secrets of this application.\n\n1. Create a ConfigMap named `agent-cm` (see exising one [here](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent/blob/master/src/main/kubernetes/configmap.yaml)) with the following `oc` command:\n\n ```shell\n  # USE this if you do not use the anomaly detection service\n  oc create configmap agent-cm \\\n  --from-literal=REEFER_TOPIC=${PROJECT_NAME}-reefers \\\n  --from-literal=TELEMETRY_TOPIC=${PROJECT_NAME}-telemetry \\\n  --from-literal=KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=${CLUSTER_NAME}-kafka-bootstrap.eventstreams.svc:9093 \\\n  --from-literal=QUARKUS_KAFKA_STREAMS_APPLICATION_ID=cold-chain-agent-${YOUR_SUFFIX} \\\n  --from-literal=KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL=SSL\n  # USE the command below if you USE the anomaly detection service\n  oc create configmap agent-cm \\\n  --from-literal=REEFER_TOPIC=${PROJECT_NAME}-reefers \\\n  --from-literal=TELEMETRY_TOPIC=${PROJECT_NAME}-telemetry \\\n  --from-literal=KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=${CLUSTER_NAME}-kafka-bootstrap.eventstreams.svc:9093 \\\n  --from-literal=QUARKUS_KAFKA_STREAMS_APPLICATION_ID=cold-chain-agent-${YOUR_SUFFIX} \\\n  --from-literal=KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL=SSL \\\n  --from-literal=PREDICTION_ENABLED=true\n\n ```\n\n  The value of `` should match the value used in the creation of the `reefer-simul-cmap` ConfigMap above. \n\n1. Define a secret for the agent, according to the option you selected:\n\n  ```shell\n  # without anomaly detection\n  oc create secret generic agent-secrets \\\n  --from-literal=KAFKA_USER=${TLS_USER} \\\n  ```\n  \n  For anomaly detection you need a user and an api_key, the anonmaly detection URL and the CP4D IAM authorization API to get the token, then do:\n\n   ```shell\n  # For anomaly detection\n  oc create secret generic agent-secrets \\\n  --from-literal=ANOMALY_DETECTION_URL=https://zen-cpd-ze.../predictions?version=2021-01-28 \\\n  --from-literal=KAFKA_USER=${TLS_USER} \\\n  --from-literal=CP4D_USER=<cp4d user>   \\\n  --from-literal=CP4D_APIKEY=<apikey>  \\\n  --from-literal=CP4D_AUTH_URL=  \\\n  --from-literal=CP4D_USER: <cp4d user> \\\n  --from-literal=CP4D_AUTH_URL: <cp4d API to get user token>\\\n  ```\n\n1. Deploy the microservice components. You have two choices depending of the fact you have cloned the repository or not.\n\n  If you have clone the repository use:\n\n  ```shell\n  ./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true -DskipTests\n  ```\n\n  If not try this deployment config:\n\n  ```shell\n  oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent/master/src/main/kubernetes/deployment.yml\n  ```\n\n  *The openshift.yaml is, in fact created using the `application.properties` and with the following command: `./mvnw clean package` and placed under `target/kubernetes`. We have copied this generated file for conveniance and update the docker image to download the one from docker hub.* \n\n## Scenario script\n\nOnce the solution is up and running, execute the following steps to present an end-to-end demonstration:\n\n### Generate vaccine container telemetry events\n\n1. Access the Vaccine Reefer Simulator's Flasgger UI via the following `oc` command:\n\n   ```shell\n   oc get route vaccine-reefer-simulator -o jsonpath=\"http://{.status.ingress[0].host}\"\n   ```\n\n2. In your web browser got the above URL and expand the **POST `/control`** and click **Try it out**.\n\n3. In the **Edit Value** text box, update the values of the records accordingly:\n    * **containerID**: `C01`\n    * **nb_of_records**: `500`\n    * **product_id**: `covid-19`\n    * **simulation**: `temperature`\n\n4. Click **Execute**.\n\n### Analyze simulated reefer telemetry data\n\n1. Access the Event Streams Console UI via the following `oc` command:\n\n   ```shell\n   oc get route -n eventstreams ${CLUSTER_NAME}-ibm-es-ui -o jsonpath=\"https://{.status.ingress[0].host}\"\n   ```\n\n2. Click **Topics** from the left navigation menu and select the topic that matches the `TELEMETRY_TOPIC` values.\n\n3. Explore the messages tab and the individual telemetry records emitted by the Vaccine Reefer Simulator component.\n\n### Analyze generated cold-chain violations\n\n1. Click **Topics** from the left navigation menu and select the topic that matches the `reefer-topic` value.\n\n2. Explore the messages tab and the observed vaccine cold-chain violation alert events.\n\n3. The reefer container information contained in this topic have been identified as having observed temperatures outside the allowable range more than the allowable number of times, as determined to preserve the state of the vaccine doses contained.\n4. Get the service routes with `oc get route reefer-monitoring-agent -o jsonpath=\"http://{.status.ingress[0].host}\"` \n4. You may go to the service API at the `<URL>/swagger-ui/` and use the interactive query to see the state of the container `C10`: \n\n ![3](./images/test-iquery.png)\n\n The response may look like:\n\n ```\n {\n  \"alreadyReportedColdChainViolation\": false,\n  \"maxRecordToKeep\": 25,\n  \"maxTemperature\": -9,\n  \"maxTemperatureRegistered\": -20,\n  \"maxViolationAllowed\": 10,\n  \"reeferID\": \"C10\",\n  \"temperatureList\": [\n    -49.92182102,\n    -49.22471643,\n    -50.9776016,\n    -31.07841667,\n    -28.75859987,\n    -32.18018047,\n    -31.04312727,\n    -28.70898255,\n    -32.03926825,\n    -31.86666432,\n    -30.40963273,\n    -49.07404188\n  ],\n  \"tooManyViolations\": false,\n  \"violatedTemperatureCount\": 0\n}\n ```\n\n### Anomaly detection\n\nIf you have deployed the anomaly detection model to Watson ML and configured the monitoring agent to call this entity, then the reefer topic will contain new message about potential issue on this refrigerator container. The downstream `reefer manager service` will assess the number of time this refrigerator was flagged as adnormal, and will trigger a business process in BPM. See [this note](/solution/bpm/) for the process application implementation detail. \n\n_note that the process application needs to be updated and the reefer manager service implemented to get the end to end scenario covered_\n\n\n### Clearing the project\n\nTo delete the different resources do the following:\n\n```shell\noc delete cm agent-cm\noc delete cm reefer-simul-cm\noc delete secret agent-secrets\noc delete secret reefer-simul-secret\noc delete deployment vaccine-reefer-simulator\noc delete deploymentconfig reefer-monitoring-agent\noc delete project coldchain\n```","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"242d633354d004bb660a80a18d5c97c9","counter":292,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cold-chain monitoring","description":"Cold-chain monitoring"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Cold-chain monitoring\ndescription: Cold-chain monitoring\n---\n\nThe vaccine lots need to be kept at a constant temperature for a period of time.

Create a ConfigMap named `agent-cm` (see exising one [here](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent/blob/master/src/main/kubernetes/configmap.yaml)) with the following `oc` command:\n\n ```shell\n  # USE this if you do not use the anomaly detection service\n  oc create configmap agent-cm \\\n  --from-literal=REEFER_TOPIC=${PROJECT_NAME}-reefers \\\n  --from-literal=TELEMETRY_TOPIC=${PROJECT_NAME}-telemetry \\\n  --from-literal=KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=${CLUSTER_NAME}-kafka-bootstrap.eventstreams.svc:9093 \\\n  --from-literal=QUARKUS_KAFKA_STREAMS_APPLICATION_ID=cold-chain-agent-${YOUR_SUFFIX} \\\n  --from-literal=KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL=SSL\n  # USE the command below if you USE the anomaly detection service\n  oc create configmap agent-cm \\\n  --from-literal=REEFER_TOPIC=${PROJECT_NAME}-reefers \\\n  --from-literal=TELEMETRY_TOPIC=${PROJECT_NAME}-telemetry \\\n  --from-literal=KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=${CLUSTER_NAME}-kafka-bootstrap.eventstreams.svc:9093 \\\n  --from-literal=QUARKUS_KAFKA_STREAMS_APPLICATION_ID=cold-chain-agent-${YOUR_SUFFIX} \\\n  --from-literal=KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL=SSL \\\n  --from-literal=PREDICTION_ENABLED=true\n\n ```\n\n  The value of `` should match the value used in the creation of the `reefer-simul-cmap` ConfigMap above. \n\n1. Define a secret for the agent, according to the option you selected:\n\n  ```shell\n  # without anomaly detection\n  oc create secret generic agent-secrets \\\n  --from-literal=KAFKA_USER=${TLS_USER} \\\n  ```\n  \n  For anomaly detection you need a user and an api_key, the anonmaly detection URL and the CP4D IAM authorization API to get the token, then do:\n\n   ```shell\n  # For anomaly detection\n  oc create secret generic agent-secrets \\\n  --from-literal=ANOMALY_DETECTION_URL=https://zen-cpd-ze.../predictions?version=2021-01-28 \\\n  --from-literal=KAFKA_USER=${TLS_USER} \\\n  --from-literal=CP4D_USER=<cp4d user>   \\\n  --from-literal=CP4D_APIKEY=<apikey>  \\\n  --from-literal=CP4D_AUTH_URL=  \\\n  --from-literal=CP4D_USER: <cp4d user> \\\n  --from-literal=CP4D_AUTH_URL: <cp4d API to get user token>\\\n  ```\n\n1. Deploy the microservice components. You have two choices depending of the fact you have cloned the repository or not.\n\n  If you have clone the repository use:\n\n  ```shell\n  ./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true -DskipTests\n  ```\n\n  If not try this deployment config:\n\n  ```shell\n  oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-monitoring-agent/master/src/main/kubernetes/deployment.yml\n  ```\n\n  *The openshift.yaml is, in fact created using the `application.properties` and with the following command: `./mvnw clean package` and placed under `target/kubernetes`. We have copied this generated file for conveniance and update the docker image to download the one from docker hub.* \n\n## Scenario script\n\nOnce the solution is up and running, execute the following steps to present an end-to-end demonstration:\n\n### Generate vaccine container telemetry events\n\n1. Access the Vaccine Reefer Simulator's Flasgger UI via the following `oc` command:\n\n   ```shell\n   oc get route vaccine-reefer-simulator -o jsonpath=\"http://{.status.ingress[0].host}\"\n   ```\n\n2. In your web browser got the above URL and expand the **POST `/control`** and click **Try it out**.\n\n3. In the **Edit Value** text box, update the values of the records accordingly:\n    * **containerID**: `C01`\n    * **nb_of_records**: `500`\n    * **product_id**: `covid-19`\n    * **simulation**: `temperature`\n\n4. Click **Execute**.\n\n### Analyze simulated reefer telemetry data\n\n1. Access the Event Streams Console UI via the following `oc` command:\n\n   ```shell\n   oc get route -n eventstreams ${CLUSTER_NAME}-ibm-es-ui -o jsonpath=\"https://{.status.ingress[0].host}\"\n   ```\n\n2. Click **Topics** from the left navigation menu and select the topic that matches the `TELEMETRY_TOPIC` values.\n\n3. Explore the messages tab and the individual telemetry records emitted by the Vaccine Reefer Simulator component.\n\n### Analyze generated cold-chain violations\n\n1. Click **Topics** from the left navigation menu and select the topic that matches the `reefer-topic` value.\n\n2. Explore the messages tab and the observed vaccine cold-chain violation alert events.\n\n3. The reefer container information contained in this topic have been identified as having observed temperatures outside the allowable range more than the allowable number of times, as determined to preserve the state of the vaccine doses contained.\n4. Get the service routes with `oc get route reefer-monitoring-agent -o jsonpath=\"http://{.status.ingress[0].host}\"` \n4. You may go to the service API at the `<URL>/swagger-ui/` and use the interactive query to see the state of the container `C10`: \n\n ![3](./images/test-iquery.png)\n\n The response may look like:\n\n ```\n {\n  \"alreadyReportedColdChainViolation\": false,\n  \"maxRecordToKeep\": 25,\n  \"maxTemperature\": -9,\n  \"maxTemperatureRegistered\": -20,\n  \"maxViolationAllowed\": 10,\n  \"reeferID\": \"C10\",\n  \"temperatureList\": [\n    -49.92182102,\n    -49.22471643,\n    -50.9776016,\n    -31.07841667,\n    -28.75859987,\n    -32.18018047,\n    -31.04312727,\n    -28.70898255,\n    -32.03926825,\n    -31.86666432,\n    -30.40963273,\n    -49.07404188\n  ],\n  \"tooManyViolations\": false,\n  \"violatedTemperatureCount\": 0\n}\n ```\n\n### Anomaly detection\n\nIf you have deployed the anomaly detection model to Watson ML and configured the monitoring agent to call this entity, then the reefer topic will contain new message about potential issue on this refrigerator container. The downstream `reefer manager service` will assess the number of time this refrigerator was flagged as adnormal, and will trigger a business process in BPM. See [this note](/solution/bpm/) for the process application implementation detail. \n\n_note that the process application needs to be updated and the reefer manager service implemented to get the end to end scenario covered_\n\n\n### Clearing the project\n\nTo delete the different resources do the following:\n\n```shell\noc delete cm agent-cm\noc delete cm reefer-simul-cm\noc delete secret agent-secrets\noc delete secret reefer-simul-secret\noc delete deployment vaccine-reefer-simulator\noc delete deploymentconfig reefer-monitoring-agent\noc delete project coldchain\n```","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/vaccine-solution-main/vaccine-solution-main/docs/src/pages/use-cases/cold-chain/index.mdx"}}}}
