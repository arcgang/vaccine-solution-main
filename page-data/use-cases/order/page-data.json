A deep dive to the Operational Research problem is described in [this note](/solution/orderms/voro-solution/). \nIn this use case / lab you will learn how to integrate with Kafka using the Outbox pattern, and Debezium to capture change to the postgresql table, how to integrate an Operational Research / advanced analytics component in an event-driven architecture which acts on new order events, to improve the shipment plan, how to deploy those component using GitOps approach, and finally how to use Quarkus and microprofile reactive messaging.\n\n## Target Audiences\n\nYou will be greatly interested by the subjects addressed in this use case if you are:\n\n* **an architect,** as you will get a deeper understanding on how all the components work together, and how to adopt event-driven approach to this problem which is mostly seen as a batch processing in traditional It architecture.\n* **a developer,** as you will get a broader view of the solution end-to-end, as well as insight into practices to reuse during your future implementations.\n\n## The what \n\nIn this scenario we want to demonstrate the order entry with an event-driven microservice, and the integration with an event driven linear programming stateful function. The scenario addresses the following features:\n\n* Create Order(s) using a simple user interface as an order manager will do after interacting with the country health care request.\n* Validate the [transactional outbox pattern](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/patterns/intro/#transactional-outbox) works to get OrderCreated, OrderUpdated or OrderCancelled Events created into a dedicated table in Postgresql\n* Validate how [Debezium Change Data Capture](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.4/connectors/postgresql.html) for Postgresql as a Kafka connector, produces OrderEvents from the table to Kafka `orders` topic.\n* Integrate with the [Shipment plan optimization]() to get the updated shipment plan as events.\n\n### Components involved in this use case\n\n* [Vaccine Order Service](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-order-mgr-pg)\n* Postgres DB\n* Debezium for change data capture on the outbox table\n* Kafka using Strimzi or [event streams](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/)\n* [Vaccine Order Reefer Optimization Service](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-order-optimizer)\n\n ![](../../solution/orderms/images/vaccine-order-1.png)\n\n*The blockchain integration is not done yet*\n\nTo have a deeper understanding of the order service read [this overview section](/solution/orderms/#overview). For the Vaccine order reefer optimization service [the design article](/design/voro/) details the optimization approach, while the [solution article](/solution/orderms/voro-solution/#overview) goes over the service implementation details.\n\n## Deploy to OpenShift \n\nWe propose to use gitops to deploy the Kafka, Postgres and the different services of this solution in few `oc` commands.\n\n### Pre-requisites\n\n* You need:\n    * docker and docker compose on your laptop to run locally or build image\n    * Java 11\n    * git client \n    * Get access to an OpenShift cluster with Cloud Pak for integration and event streams installed.\n\n1.
